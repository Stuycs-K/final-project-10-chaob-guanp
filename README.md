## Overview
For our project, we have decided to create a 2D fighting game inspired by Dragon Ball FighterZ/Dragon Ball Extreme Butoden. Features to be included will be similar to these games, such as light attacks, medium attacks, and heavy attacks. The game would be played by two players, each controlling a characters on the same keyboard with different keybinds based on the side of the keyboard you are on.

## Instructions
General controls:
- "=" -> toggle hitboxes

Player 1 controls:
- 'w' -> jump
- 'a' -> move left
- 's' -> crouch/block
- 'd' -> move right
- 'e' -> light attack
- 'r' -> medium attack
- 't' -> heavy attack

Player 2 controls:
- 'o' -> jump
- 'k' -> move left
- 'l' -> crouch/block
- ';' -> move right
- 'p' -> light attack
- '[' -> medium attack
- ']' -> heavy attack

How to Play:
- When you run the game on processing there will be a character selection screen with text telling you to pick the character for Player1 and then Player2. You can click on either the box with Goku or Vegeta. After picking the characters you want to use, the screen will change into the battle scene when you and your friend can battle
it out until one player reaches 0 HP or when the timer hits 0. When this happens an end screen will come up with
a button that says "Menu" where you can go back to the character selection screen and play again.
